# ns_houserobbery
This is a comprehensive house robbery script for FiveM role-play servers running on ESX Legacy 1.8.5 and above. It's an advanced and highly configurable system that allows players to engage in interactive robberies on a variety of houses in the world. The script's dependencies are ESX Legacy (from version 1.8.5 onwards) and ox_lib.

Key Features
Configurable Options: The script includes a robust configuration file which allows the server owner to adjust a wide range of parameters including timers, required items for the robbery, and more.

Robbery Details: Each house that can be robbed is detailed in the configuration file, including points to disable the alarm, skill check difficulties, and collection points with chances for different types of loot.

Multiplayer: The script supports multiple players participating in the robbery, either cooperating or competing for the loot.

Cooldown Mechanism: A cooldown system is integrated into the script to avoid constant house robberies, enhancing the role-play experience.

Please note that this script has been designed to work seamlessly with ESX Legacy and ox_lib.
